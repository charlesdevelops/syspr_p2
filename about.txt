how the makefile works:

CC: Compiler to use.
CFLAGS: Compiler flags to use.
OBJS: All object files that need to be linked together.
mysync: Target to build the mysync executable.
clean: Target to clean compiled files.

How to use the makefile:
literally just run `make` in the terminal. currently just prints helloworld.
